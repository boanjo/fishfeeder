# fishfeeder
DIY fishfeeder using standard sewer pipes and 3D printed housing. Wemos D1 mini for interfacing via a web gui and controlling the DC servo for the feeding.

This is only a simple sample code for the [instructables.com](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Fish-chicken-Feeder/) article. The actual Fishfeeder i'm using is part of the [Poseidon - Pond Control 2.0](https://github.com/boanjo/poseidon) project that includes more parts. Clone or download models from the Poseidon project as the HW is the same for these repos.
